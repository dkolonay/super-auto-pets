## **Editing the site**

Start by navigating to the project folder and installing dependencies :

    npm install

To get the most out of editing the site in a local environment, you'll need to install the Gatsby CLI globally :

    npm install -g gatsby-cli

Get live updates while editing with gatsby develop and navigating to localhost:8000 in your browser :

    gatsby develop


Compile the production build :

    gatsby build
